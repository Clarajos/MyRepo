#Data and File Overview
"Nutrients2018.csv"and "Nutrients2020" are CSVs containing measurements of various nutrients for each site and location within the sampled dry season (2018) and wet season (2020), respectively. 

"Pesticides2018.csv"and "Pesticides2020" are CSVs containing measurements of various pesticides for each site and location within the sampled dry season (2018) and wet season (2020), respectively.  

"Waterchem2018.csv"and "Waterchem2020" are CSVs containing physico-chemical measurements of water for each site and location within the sampled dry season (2018) and wet season (2020), respectively. 

"Sediment2018.csv"and "Sediments2020" are CSVs containing sediment composition measurements for each site and location within the sampled dry season (2018) and wet season (2020), respectively. 

All files relate to the same study, with all measurements being obtained through chemical analysis of the same water samples from each study site.
The original files were all created on the 2024-02-23. Files were updated on 2025-04-11 to change the proprietary format from excel to csv. 
To our knowledge, all collected data is described in these datasets
