#Data and File Overview
"eDNA_Data.csv" is a csv containing operational taxonomic units of the occurrences of each species (based on the Tele01 and Elas02 primer set) for each site and location within both sampled seasons (2018-dry, 2020-wet). 

This file is part of a wider dataset that includes environmental variables (nutrients, pesticides, water chemsitry and sediments), all of which were obtained from the same water samples from each study site.

The file was created on 2024-02-23. Files were updated on 2025-04-11 to change the proprietary format from excel to csv. 

Related data collected includes "Elas_AmpliconPipeline_log.txt" and "Tele_AmpliconPipeline_log.txt" available from the original publisher of the data at <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ttdz08m16>. These text files contains the bionformatics processing used on DNA sequencing results to match sequences to species and site within a reference database.

#Sharing and Access
The data is currently only available on Dryad on a public domain licence: <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ttdz08m16>.

#Data-specific information
"eDNA_Data.csv" provides presence (1) and absence (0) data on 193 different species for each site (68 sites altogether across both seasons). As such, there are 68 variables with 193 counts.

Variables are the species' names. The following information is provided here, namely the species' superkingdom, kigdnom, phylum, subphylum, class, order , family, genus, species, taxa and conservation significance. 

'GR' refers to Gregory River location, 'SC' is Sandy Creek, 'SH' is St Helen's/Murray Creek and 'HAR' is	Mackay Harbour.
'2018' refers to the sampled dry season and '2020' refers to the sampled wet season. 

'N/A' was used to record missing data.
